The Genome Sequence Annotation Server (GenSAS) is an online platform that provides a pipeline for whole genome structural and functional annotation for eukaryotes and prokaryotes. 

Users can upload genome sequences and select from a variety of tools for repeat masking, prediction of gene models and other structural features as well as functional annotation tools.  

GenSAS integrates with JBrowse and Apollo to provide visualization and editing. For more details about GenSAS, please see our User's Guide.
