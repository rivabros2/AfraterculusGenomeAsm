“Chromosome-scale genome assembly of the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus sp. 1”


#Abstract:


This study presents the results of whole-genome sequencing and chromosome-scale assembly derived from single female and male of the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus Brazilian 1 morphotype (or sp.1).  Additionally, we provide a complete assembly of the mitochondrial genome and analyzed the key nuclear and mitochondrial genomic features, including coding genes, repetitive regions, and ribosomal RNA. These findings offer valuable insights for population genomics and comparative evolutionary studies. Furthermore, our research contributes to the characterization of potential target genes for genetic engineering (e.g., gene editing) and RNAi technologies, which could complement existing pest control strategies, such as the sterile insect technique, or aid in the development of novel biocontrol methods.
